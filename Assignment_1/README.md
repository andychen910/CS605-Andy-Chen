\# CS605 Assignment 1 - Simple Calculator



\## What this project does

This is my first assignment for CS605.  

I made a simple calculator in Python using Google Colab.  

It can do 4 basic math operations:

\- Addition

\- Subtraction

\- Multiplication

\- Division



The program also asks if the user wants to keep going or stop.

\## How to run it

1\. Open the file `calculator.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

2\. Run the cells one by one.

3\. When the program asks, type:

&nbsp;  - The first number

&nbsp;  - The second number

&nbsp;  - The operation you want (1 = add, 2 = subtract, 3 = multiply, 4 = divide)

4\. It will show the result.

5\. You can type \*\*yes\*\* to do another calculation or \*\*no\*\* to exit.
